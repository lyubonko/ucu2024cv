# Deep Learning for Computer Vision Assigments

## Module 2: Mini-Project Assignment

### Task
Conduct a series of experiments in Computer Vision & Deep Learning and document them in a report. 

Please use tutorials as a starting code 
- https://github.com/lyubonko/ucu2024cv/tree/main/practice

### Requirements

- **Problem/Dataset**: Computer Vision problem (images or video) solved using Deep Learning methods.

Possible projects/tasks:

* **Custom CNN Model:**
  - Design and implement a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for the selected dataset. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
  - Experiment with different architectures (e.g., number of layers, filter sizes) and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) to improve accuracy. Analyze how these changes affect the model's performance and training time.

* **Finetuning ResNet:**
    - Fine-tune the ResNet18/ResNet34/ResNet50 model on the selected dataset to improve performance compared to the linear probe. Discuss the impact of fine-tuning on model accuracy and convergence speed.
    - Compare the results of fine-tuning with different learning rates and schedules. Evaluate which hyperparameters yield the best trade-off between training time and performance.
    - Create a dashboard using FiftyOne to visualize misclassified images after model inference and identify patterns or features causing classification errors.

* **Finetuning ViT:**
   - Fine-tune the ResNet18/ResNet34/ResNet50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to improve performance compared to the linear probe. Discuss the impact of fine-tuning on model accuracy and convergence speed.
   - Compare the results of fine-tuning with different learning rates and schedules. Evaluate which hyperparameters yield the best trade-off between training time and performance.
    - Create a dashboard using FiftyOne to visualize misclassified images after model inference and identify patterns or features causing classification errors.

* **Linear Probe of DINOv2 and CLIP:**
   - Utilize a pre-trained DINOv2 model to perform a linear probe dataset. Evaluate the model's effectiveness in extracting meaningful features for classification.
   - Analyze the feature embeddings generated by DINOv2 using dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE or PCA to visualize the separability of classes in feature space.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
* You can combine different tasks
* You can propose your own task/project
